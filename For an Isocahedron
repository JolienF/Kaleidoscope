FOR PLATONIC BODIES

AIM

What we want to calculate: angle of temper, angle of cuttingline on mirrors.
From the following information: the characteristics of an isocahedron and mirrors

CHARACTERISTICS OF ISOCAHEDRON
(all info from wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron)

an isocahedron has 20 sides of equilateral triangles.
This means that the base surface (this is what I call the surface that is repetitavely reflected) exists of an equilateral triangle.
So, the angles of the base surface are all 60°.

The dihedral angle, the angle between two surfaces, is  arccos(−√5/3) which is about 138.189685°.

That is all the information we need

TEMPER CALCULATION
The temper is calculated from the dihedral angle by dividing it by 2. 
Characteristic mirror: the distance between the object and the mirror is the same as the distance between the mirror and the virtual object.
The angle between the base surface (object) and the virtual surface should be the dihedral angle (138°).
The mirror is always halfway the object and the mirrored object and so the temper of the mirror is 138/2= 69°
